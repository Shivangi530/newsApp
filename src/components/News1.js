                The move comes after nearly two years since PayPal enabled users
                to buy and sell crypto on its platform. After rolling out the
                ability to buy and sell crypto on its platform in October 2020,
                PayPal is finally allowing users the ability to natively
                transfer, send and receive digital assets between PayPal and
                other wallets and exchanges. As of Tuesday, the feature is
                available to select U.S. users, with the feature expanding to
                all eligible U.S. users in the coming weeks. The first batch of
                supported coins consists of -{" "}

                In addition, customers who transfer their crypto onto PayPal can
                spend it via Checkout at millions of merchant terminals. The
                company has been granted a full Bitlicense by the New York
                Department of Financial Services for the conduct.

                Users would simply need to log in to their accounts and enter
                the crypto section of the application to start transferring
                coins. Users are generally required to complete a one-time ID
                verification before the procedure.

                Crypto transfers to recipients outside of PayPal would incur a
                network fee based on their respective blockchains, but transfers
                between PayPal users will not incur such fees. To protect users'
                privacy, the firm generates a new recipient address for each
                transaction into one's PayPal account. PayPal will also not
                charge fees for incoming transfers,
              </p>

                The company is also working to integrate other forms of
                cryptocurrency services, such as central bank digital
                currencies, to boost its digital footprint. It is also exploring
                the possibility of launching its own stablecoin, dubbed "PayPal
                Coin." The discovery came after a developer found evidence of
                such a stablecoin within the source code of the company's iPhone
                app.
