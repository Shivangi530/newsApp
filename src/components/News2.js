              Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's new bill also includes an
              incentive for those declaring crypto for tax purposes.

              Crypto traders in Italy will be subject to a 26% capital-gains tax
              starting in 2023, according to a new budget that won parliamentary
              approval on Thursday.

              Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's 2023 expansionary budget -
              which was completed in a rush before the end of the year -
              features 21 billion euros ($22.3 billion) in tax breaks to assist
              businesses and households facing the energy crisis, Reuters
              reported.

              Italy's (and most recently Portugal's) move to introduce a
              capital-gains tax on crypto comes ahead of the implementation of
              the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulaIn
              Italy, where crypto remains largely unregulated, the 387-page
              budget legitimizes crypto assets by defining them as "a digital
              representation of value or rights, which can be transferred and
              stored electronically, using the technology of distributed ledger
              or similar technology."tion that promises a licensing frameworks
              and stringent operating requirements for crypto-service providers
              in the 27-member bloc.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 26% rate applies to gains from crypto trading if they exceed
              2,000 euros per tax period. As an incentive for declaring crypto
              profits, the new bill also sets a "substitute income tax" for
              investors at 14% of the value of the assets held as of Jan. 1,
              2023, instead of the cost at the time of purchase. According to
              the new rules, losses from crypto investments can be deducted from
              profits and be carried forward.

              Investors, however, may require some additional guidance on what
              qualifies as a taxable event as the document also says, "the
              exchange between crypto assets having same characteristics and
              functions," doesn't constitute a "fiscal case."
